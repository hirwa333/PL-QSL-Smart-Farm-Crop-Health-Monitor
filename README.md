# Smart Farm Crop Health Monitor
A comprehensive, beginner-to-advanced project covering smart agriculture, crop health monitoring, environmental sensing, data analysis, and GitHub workflows for project development.

## Project Initiation
This project was initiated and developed as part of academic instruction and practical training to support learners in understanding smart farming technologies. It is intended for students, developers, data analysts, agricultural engineers, and IT professionals seeking strong competencies in crop health monitoring and IoT-based farming solutions.
